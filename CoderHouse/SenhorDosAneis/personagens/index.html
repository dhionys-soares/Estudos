        <div class="cards"><p>Frodo, child of the respectable Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, was born on 22 September of T.A. 2968. After his parents died in a boating accident, Frodo went to live in Brandy Hall with his mother’s relatives, the Brandybucks. He grew up under the guardianship of the Master of Buckland Rorimac "Goldfather" Brandybuck, who was his uncle. Frodo was caught several times stealing mushrooms from Farmer Maggot, who, on the last incident, thrashed Frodo and set his three dogs to chase Frodo from Bamfurlong to Bucklebury Ferry. Frodo was terrified of them afterwards.[2]

        Frodo stayed in Buckland until his "uncle" Bilbo adopted him and took him in to live in Bag End, Bilbo's house in Hobbiton. He enjoyed life with Bilbo, with whom he shared the same birthday - though others often called the old hobbit "queer." Bilbo taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the elvish tongue. Frodo was the only one Bilbo allowed to read his memoirs. Bilbo made Frodo his heir, frustrating the attempts of the disagreeable Sackville-Bagginses, who coveted the estate of Bag End.[3]
        
        The two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about adventure; they were sometimes seen by Wandering Companies of Elves, though the hobbits did not see them. When they returned home, Bilbo would tell Frodo that the Road is like a massive river, and all porches are its "springs" and all paths are its "tributaries".[4]
        
        Frodo and Bilbo were comfortable and well off until T.A. 3001. At this time, Bilbo threw an enormous party to celebrate his 111th birthday, and Frodo's 33rd, the date of Frodo's coming of age. At this party Bilbo gave his farewell speech, and made his long-planned "disappearance" and withdrawal from the Shire. Frodo, who had been informed beforehand of the "joke", as Bilbo called it, was spared the shock that afflicted the other assembled Hobbits. Frodo returned home as the new Master of Bag End, as per Bilbo's will. He was greeted there by Gandalf, who informed him that, among other things, Frodo had inherited Bilbo's magic ring.</p>
